*  How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  The best way to interpret user needs is to first gather as much information as possible and to make sure to understand all of the goals and requirements that the user wants. Then take those goals and requirements and turn them into actual features of a program and clean it up as you continue to receive more feedback. User stories help by making requirement gathering much clearer and it keeps the workload manageable.
  
*  How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  When I develop my own programs I am always taking an iterative approach and fixing my program as I find bugs or want to change the functionality. When I eventually join a software development team I hope to utilize sprint plannings and daily standups to get a better idea of what my goals are for the week. Working alone sometimes leaves me lost with all of the different tasks I have to accomplish.

*  What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  I believe that a good team member in software development means to be a respectful team player who is always trying to offer a helping hand when available. Also someone who is able to communicate effectively and is open to constructive feedback.
